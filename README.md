<h2>Context</h2>

<I> "From World Health Organization - On 31 December 2019" </I>, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus.

This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019-20 novel coronavirus. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.

The data encourage the analysis of time series, which will allow us to look at the studied phenomenon not only in a point-like manner.
