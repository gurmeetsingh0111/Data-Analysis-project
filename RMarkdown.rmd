# Introduction

The aim of this kernel is understand COVID-19 India better, by implementing/viewing the data graphically

### The Story of COVID-19 in India
  The COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest global humanitarian challenge the world has faced since World War II. The virus has spread widely, and the number of cases is rising daily as governments work to slow its spread. India has moved quickly, implementing a proactive, nationwide, 21-day lockdown, with the goal of flattening the curve and using the time to plan and resource responses adequately.

## Load libraries

We load a range of libraries for general data wrangling and visualization. 

```{r}

library(readr) 
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

```
### Reading the dataset
```{r}
Details <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gurmeetsingh0111/Data-Analysis-project/master/IndividualDetails.csv")
#load the data from the given link
```
### Cleaning the data by removing the `NA` values and some coloumns which are not that useful 
```{r}
data = Details[,c(1,3,4,5,8,9,10,11)]  #taking only necessary columns 
 
d_subset = na.omit(data)              #Removing the NA values
write.csv(d_subset, file="file.csv") #Writing a new file with the cleaned data

d_subset<-as.data.frame(d_subset)  #Converting it into a data frame
```
<B><I>Note that after removing all the NA values the data remained is 12.35% of the original data.</I>
Results of the analysis done may vary than the original results as mentioned above that after cleaning , 87.65% of the data was lost due to incomplete rows or columns in the original data</B>

setting the date format
```{r}
d_subset$diagnosed_date<-as.Date(d_subset$diagnosed_date,'%d/%m/%Y') #Setting the date format
```
## Data Visualization

### Age Group Analysis
```{r}
age<-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gurmeetsingh0111/Data-Analysis-project/master/AgeGroupDetails.csv") #This csv file contains the data of patients grouped by their age . This file is computed with the help of the above file "IndividualDetails.csv"
#converting it into the data frame
age<-as.data.frame(age) 
#lbls is vector contains the name of the age groups
lbls<-c("0-9","10-19","20-29","30-39","40-49","50-59","60-69","70-79",">=80")
#pct is a which contains the percentage of patients in a particular age group   
pct<-c(age$Percentage)
#we concatinate the lbls and pct vectors seprated by "->" to make it easily readable
lbls<-paste(lbls,pct,sep = "->")
#making a pie chart for "Age group wise distribution" from the above details
pie(age$TotalCases,labels=lbls,col=rainbow(length(age$AgeGroup)),radius=1,border=1,main="Age group wise distribution")
```

We could see that the <B>age group <50 is the most affected </B> which is against the trend which says elderly people are more at risk of being affected. Only 16% of people >60 are affected.
May be because young people meet and travel much more than older people so they were under the threat of community transmission...!

### Percentage of gender
```{r}
#fm is a table variable containing the frequency of genders in the data 
fm<-table(d_subset$gender)
#totalfemales in the data 
totalfemale<-fm[1]
#totoal males in the data
totalmale<-fm[2]

slices <- c(fm[1],fm[2])
#pct has the percenatge of how many females and males are there
pct <- round(slices/sum(slices)*100)
#lbls works as lable while printing the pie chart
lbls <- c("Female", "Male")
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct) # add percents to labels
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels
#making a pie chart of "Gender % of affected people" from the above details
pie(slices,labels = lbls, col=rainbow(length(lbls)),radius=1,border=1,
    main="Gender % of affected people")
```

This Tells that Female patients are very less as compared to the male patients.
Men were the most affected accounting to 74%

### Current status of patients
```{r}
#status contians the frequency of the current status of the patient
status<-table(d_subset$current_status)
#plotting the current status os the petienta 
barplot(status,col=c("red","orange","green"),xlab = "Current Status",ylim=c(0,1000),ylab = "No. of patients",main = "Status of patients")
```

Most of them are still held in quarantine

```{r}
#spect contains the percentage of current status of patients 
spect<-round(status/sum(status)*100)
#lbls wlll works as a lable for pie chart
lbls<-c("Deceasead","Hospitalized","Recovered")
#concatinating to make it easily readable
lbls<-paste(lbls,spect,sep = "->")
lbls<-paste(lbls,"%",sep = "")
#plotting a pie chart for "Condition of people" from the above details 
pie(status,labels=lbls,col=rainbow(3),radius=1,border=1,main="Condition of people")
```

Only 2% of the total affected people died 

### Recovery of patients gender wise
```{r}
#filtering the data frame using "dplyr" library to obtain specific results
recovered1<-filter(d_subset,d_subset$gender=='M' & d_subset$current_status=="Recovered")
recovered2<-filter(d_subset,d_subset$gender=='F' & d_subset$current_status=="Recovered")
#rc1  has the no. of male patients recovered 
rc1<-as.integer(count(recovered1))
#rc2 has the no. of female patients recovered 
rc2<-as.integer(count(recovered2))
deceased1<-filter(d_subset,d_subset$gender=='M' & d_subset$current_status=="Deceased")
deceased2<-filter(d_subset,d_subset$gender=='F' & d_subset$current_status=="Deceased")
#dc1 has the no. of male patients deceased
dc1<-as.integer(count(deceased1))
#dc2 has the no. of female patients deseaced
dc2<-as.integer(count(deceased2))

c1<-c(rc1,rc2)
c1
c2<-c(dc1,dc2)
c2
rd<-c("Males","Females")
#plotting a bar plot for "People Recovered" from the above details from the above data
barplot(c1, main="People Recovered",names.arg = rd,
        ylab="no of patients",ylim =c(0,50), col=c("darkblue","red"),
         )
#plotting a bar plot for "People Deceased" from the above details from the above data
barplot(c2, main="People Deceased",names.arg = rd,
        ylab="no of patients",ylim =c(0,50), col=c("darkblue","red"),
)
```

### Recovery,Deceased ratio of Males v/s Females
```{r}
#pfr has the percentage of females recovered
pfr<-round((rc2/totalfemale)*100)
#pmr has the percenatge of males recovered
pmr<-round((rc1/totalmale)*100)
#pct percentage vector
pct <- c(pmr,pfr)
lbls <- c("Males Recovered", "Females Recovered")
#concatinating to make easily readable
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct,sep="->") # add percents to labels
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels
#plotting the pie chart for "Recovery percenatge of females vs males"
pie(pct,labels = lbls, col=rainbow(length(lbls)),
    main="Recovery percenatge of females vs males")

#pfd has the percentage of females deceased
pfd<-round((dc2/totalfemale)*100)
#pfd has the percentage of males deceased
pmd<-round((dc1/totalmale)*100)
pct <- c(pfd,pmd)
lbls <- c("Females Deceased", "Males Deceased")
#concatinating to make easily readable
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct,sep="->") # add percents to labels
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels
#plotting the pie chart for "Deceased percenatge of females vs males" from the above data
pie(pct,labels = lbls, col=rainbow(length(lbls)),
    main="Deceased percenatge of females vs males")
```

### Quarantine gender ratio
```{r}
#filtering the data frame using "dplyr" library to obtain specific results
q1<-filter(d_subset,d_subset$gender=='M' & d_subset$current_status=="Hospitalized")
q2<-filter(d_subset,d_subset$gender=='F' & d_subset$current_status=="Hospitalized")
qc1<-as.integer(count(q1))
#qc1 has the no. of males currently hospitalized
qc1
qc2<-as.integer(count(q2))
#qc2 has the no. of females currently hospitalized
qc2
q<-c(qc2,qc1)
#percentage of females hospitalized
pfq<-round((qc2/totalfemale)*100)
#percentage of males hospitalized
pmq<-round((qc1/totalmale)*100)
pct <- c(pfq,pmq)
lbls <- c("Females Hospitilized", "Males Hospitilized")
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct,sep="->") # add percents to labels
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels
#plotting the pie chart for "Hospitilized percenatge of females vs males" from the above data
pie(pct,labels = lbls, col=rainbow(length(lbls)),
    main="Hospitilized percenatge of females vs males")

```

Both 90% of Males and Females are still in quarantine

### No. Of Cases per day
```{r}
#filtering the data frame using "dplyr" library to obtain specific results
ad<- d_subset %>%
  group_by(diagnosed_date)%>%
  summarise(n_distinct(id))
ad
#changing to column names to make it easy to use
colnames(ad)<-c("date","cases")
#setting the date format
ad$date<-as.Date(ad$date,'%d/%m/%Y')
require(ggplot2)
#plotting the line plot for "cases per day" from the above data
ggplot(data = ad,aes(date,cases))+geom_line()+labs(title = "Cases per day")
```

### Max cases on a single day
```{r}
#calculating which day as the maximum no. of cases 
m=max(ad[,2])
r=0
for(i in 1:nrow(ad))
  if(ad[i,2]!=m)
    {r=r+1}else{break}
print("Maximum cases on a single day were on ")
print(ad[r+1,1])
```

### Statewise Insights
```{r}
#filtering the data frame using "dplyr" library to obtain specific results
State<- d_subset %>%
  group_by(detected_state)%>%
  summarise(n_distinct(id))
#changing to column names to make it easy to use
colnames(State)<-c("state","cases")
#plotting the barplot for "No. of Patient State wise" from the above data 
barplot(State$cases,col=rainbow(29),names.arg = State$state,las=2,ylab = "No. of patients",main = "No. of Patient State wise")
```

This tells us which state got the most no. Of cases currently

### Outsiders affected by the virus in Inida
```{r}
#filtering the data frame using "dplyr" library to obtain specific results
nation=d_subset%>%
  group_by(nationality)%>%
  summarise(n_distinct(id))
#changing to column names to make it easy to use
colnames(nation)<-c("nationality","cases")
#removing the rows containg the data of india 
row_to_keep = c(FALSE,FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE,TRUE, TRUE)
nation = nation[row_to_keep,]
#plotting the barplot for "No. of NRI Patient" in india from the above details
barplot(nation$cases,col=rainbow(8),names.arg = nation$nationality,las=2,ylab = "No. of patients",main = "No. of NRI Patient")
```

We can say that these people carried virus from thier respective countries or from anyother county to India while travlling

### Fatality Rate
```{r}
#tdeaths has the total no. of deaths 
tdeaths=0
#fdeaths has the no. of females died 
fdeaths=0
#mdeath has the no. of males dies
mdeaths=0
#loop for calculating the total deaths
for(i in 1:nrow(d_subset)){
  if(d_subset[i,7]=="Deceased")
    tdeaths=tdeaths+1
}
#loop for calculating the total female deaths
for(i in 1:nrow(d_subset)){
  if(d_subset[i,7]=="Deceased"&&d_subset[i,4]=="F")
    fdeaths=fdeaths+1
}
#loop for calculating the total male deaths
for(i in 1:nrow(d_subset)){
  if(d_subset[i,7]=="Deceased"&&d_subset[i,4]=="M")
    mdeaths=mdeaths+1
}
mdeaths
fdeaths
tdeaths
#Calculating the Fatality rate
fratefemale=fdeaths/totalfemale*100
#Fatality rate of females
fratefemale
fratemale=mdeaths/totalmale*100
#Fatality rate of males
fratemale
#Overall Fatality rate 
frate=tdeaths/1047*100
frate
rate<-c(fratefemale,fratemale)
lbls<-c("Female fatality rate","Male fatality rate")
pct<-round(rate)
#Concatinating to make it easily readable
lbls<-paste(lbls,pct,sep = "->") # add percents to labels
lbls<-paste(lbls,"%",sep = "")  # add % to labels
#plotting the pie chart for "Gender wise Fatality rate" from the above details
pie(rate,labels=lbls,col=rainbow(2),radius=1,border=1,main="Gender wise Fatality rate")
```

Difference in Fatality rate in both the genders in not that much also considering the no. of deaths were very low
